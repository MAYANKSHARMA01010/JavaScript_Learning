//!====Coding Challenge: Student Grading System===
//- Description: Create a simple application that accepts student marks, calculates 
// if the student has passed, failed, or performed exceptionally based on the defined criteria.
//  - Features:
//   - Input for total possible marks and marks obtained.
//   - Calculate if the student has passed (≥ 50%).
//   - Calculate if the student performed exceptionally (≥ 80%).
//   - Compare the student's marks against the class average.
//   - Display results in a user-friendly format.

//! SOLUTION
function studentGradingSystem(totalMarks, obtainedMark, classAverage) {
    let passingCriteria = totalMarks * 0.5; //50%;
    let exceptionalCriteria = totalMarks * 0.8; //80%;
    let hasPassed = obtainedMark >= passingCriteria;
    let hasPerformedExceptionally = obtainedMark >= exceptionalCriteria;
    let isAboveAverage = obtainedMark > classAverage;
  
    return {
      hasPassed,
      hasPerformedExceptionally,
      isAboveAverage,
    };
}
  
const results = studentGradingSystem(500, 410, 350);
